# Roadmap

- `0.9`: a version I'm using daily and finding useful
- `1.0`: a version I'm confident that others can use

# Enhancements

- useful review option: small-diffs / loc<N

# Features

- autocomplete for cli (argcomplete library?)
- options for: custom bases, custom ranges, over commits, without tickets or without GH
- notes and annotations by file
- notes and annotations by block/line
- line-by-line deep dives & approvals
- filter-by-regex for review and approve line-by-line over one or all files
- semantic grouping
- see also: `./spec.md`

# Chores

- python version: determine how low a version of 3.x can be supported

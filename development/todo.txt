- line-by-line deep dives & approvals
- filter-by-regex for review and approve line-by-line over one or all files
- semantic grouping

Ongoing:

- general refactor for tests

Questions:

- Should I focus away from the LOC of a diff, and towards building the reader's understanding through writing and paraphrasing the diff?
